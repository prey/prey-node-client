# Prey Node Client Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines recommended improvements to enhance code quality, security, maintainability, and overall performance of the Prey Node Client application.

## High Priority Improvements

### Memory and Resource Optimization

- Fix memory leaks in event listeners and socket connections:
  - Implement proper cleanup of WebSocket event listeners in `control-panel/websockets/index.js`
  - Ensure socket connections are properly closed in `socket/index.js`
- Add memory management for long-running processes:
  - Implement interval cleanup in WebSocket connection management
  - Add timeout mechanisms for operations that might hang
- Optimize file handling to reduce memory usage:
  - Implement streaming for file uploads instead of loading entire files into memory
  - Add maximum file size limits for buffer operations
  - Properly close file descriptors in all code paths
- Add resource monitoring and limits:
  - Implement memory usage tracking
  - Add configurable limits for cache sizes and queues
  - Create automatic cleanup for stale resources
- Optimize database operations:
  - Implement connection pooling with proper lifecycle management
  - Add query optimization for frequently used operations
  - Implement proper transaction handling

### Security Enhancements

- Replace deprecated `node-jsencrypt` (v1.0.0) with modern alternatives:
  - Consider `node-forge` or `crypto-js` for encryption needs
  - Implement proper key management strategies
- Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities:
  - Replace string concatenation with parameterized queries in all database operations
  - Review all user input handling throughout the application
- Address command injection vulnerability in `deleteDatabase` function (storage/database.js)
- Enforce HTTPS for all API communications with certificate validation
- Implement proper secret management instead of storing keys directly in database
- Review and update permission management in platform-specific code

### Database Management

- Implement proper connection lifecycle management:
  - Use connection pooling for better performance and resource management
  - Ensure connections are always closed after operations
  - Add timeout handling for database operations
- Create a database migration system for handling schema changes
- Add database integrity checking and automatic recovery mechanisms
- Fix platform-specific code in `deleteDatabase` (currently Windows-specific)
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields

### Dependency Updates

- Update critical dependencies:
  - `ws` (7.5.10 → 8.x) for security improvements
  - `async` (2.6.4 → 3.x) for modern Promise support
  - `graceful-fs` (4.1.15 → 4.2.x)
  - `node-schedule` (1.3.2 → latest)
- Replace GitHub URL dependencies with npm packages or pin to specific commits:
  - `buckle`, `getset`, `linus`, `os-triggers`, etc.
- Run security audit and fix vulnerabilities

### Code Structure and Architecture

- Refactor callback-based code to use async/await or Promises
- Implement consistent error handling pattern throughout the codebase
- Replace direct console.log/error calls with structured logging system:
  - Add log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
  - Implement log rotation and compression
  - Add request IDs for tracing
- Create modular structure for platform-specific code
- Standardize naming conventions (currently mixed camelCase and snake_case)

## Medium Priority Improvements

### Code Modernization

- Migrate to ES modules from CommonJS
- Implement TypeScript for type safety and better IDE support
- Use modern Node.js APIs (fs/promises instead of callback-based fs)
- Convert callbacks to async/await pattern throughout the codebase
- Implement proper dependency injection for better testability

### Performance Optimizations

- Add request timeouts for all external API calls
- Replace synchronous file operations with asynchronous versions
- Implement caching for frequently accessed configuration data
- Review and optimize database queries, adding indexes where needed
- Add batch processing for high-volume operations

### Testing Improvements

- Increase test coverage (currently minimal)
- Add integration tests for critical paths
- Implement end-to-end tests for core functionality
- Add load/performance tests for server interactions
- Set up continuous integration workflow

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Refactor platform-specific code into clearer hierarchies
- Create better abstraction layers for OS-specific operations
- Standardize platform detection and feature availability
- Improve installation process across different platforms

## Low Priority Improvements

### Developer Experience

- Standardize code formatting with Prettier (already in package.json)
- Enforce linting rules (ESLint configuration exists but not applied consistently)
- Improve documentation with JSDoc comments
- Implement Git hooks for code quality checks

### Monitoring and Observability

- Add health check endpoints
- Implement better error tracking and reporting
- Add performance metrics collection
- Create dashboards for system monitoring

### User Experience

- Improve error messages for end-users
- Enhance installation and update processes
- Add more granular configuration options
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Build and Deployment

- Standardize build process across platforms
- Implement semantic versioning management
- Add automated changelog generation
- Streamline release process

## Implementation Notes

- Start with the database connection management to prevent data corruption
- Address security issues before introducing new features
- Consider breaking changes as part of a major version update
- Test thoroughly on all supported platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Prioritize backward compatibility where possible

This roadmap should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves.
