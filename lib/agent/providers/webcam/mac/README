Imagesnap is the work of Robert Harder.

=======================================

ImageSnap is a Public Domain command-line tool that lets you capture 
still images from an iSight or other video source. You might remember 
Axel Bauer's original isightcapture tool (that is no longer supported 
but still works on most systems). With ImageSnap I hope we'll be able 
to move forward and add features, adapt to the ever-changing Apple
architectures, etc.
